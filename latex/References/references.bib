	abstract ={Here, we present PatMatch, an efficient, web-based pattern-matching program that enables searches for short nucleotide or peptide sequences such as cis-elements in nucleotide sequences or small domains and motifs in protein sequences. The program can be used to find matches to a user-specified sequence pattern that can be described using ambiguous sequence codes and a powerful and flexible pattern syntax based on regular expressions. A recent upgrade has improved performance and now supports both mismatches and wildcards in a single pattern. This enhancement has been achieved by replacing the previous searching algorithm, scan_for_matches [D'Souza et al. (1997), Trends in Genetics, 13, 497?498], with nondeterministic-reverse grep (NR-grep), a general pattern matching tool that allows for approximate string matching [Navarro (2001), Software Practice and Experience, 31, 1265?1312]. We have tailored NR-grep to be used for DNA and protein searches with PatMatch. The stand-alone version of the software can be adapted for use with any sequence dataset and is available for download at The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) at ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/tair/Software/Patmatch/. The PatMatch server is available on the web at http://www.arabidopsis.org/cgi-bin/patmatch/nph-patmatch.pl for searching Arabidopsis thaliana sequences.},

year = {2012},

abstract ={MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are major regulators of gene expression in multicellular organisms. They recognize their targets by sequence complementarity and guide them to cleavage or translational arrest. It is generally accepted that plant miRNAs have extensive complementarity to their targets and their prediction usually relies on the use of empirical parameters deduced from known miRNA–target interactions. Here, we developed a strategy to identify miRNA targets which is mainly based on the conservation of the potential regulation in different species. We applied the approach to expressed sequence tags datasets from angiosperms. Using this strategy, we predicted many new interactions and experimentally validated previously unknown miRNA targets in Arabidopsis thaliana. Newly identified targets that are broadly conserved include auxin regulators, transcription factors and transporters. Some of them might participate in the same pathways as the targets known before, suggesting that some miRNAs might control different aspects of a biological process. Furthermore, this approach can be used to identify targets present in a specific group of species, and, as a proof of principle, we analyzed Solanaceae-specific targets. The presented strategy can be used alone or in combination with other approaches to find miRNA targets in plants.},

	ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:A class of eukaryotic non-coding RNAs termed microRNAs (miRNAs) interact with target mRNAs by sequence complementarity to regulate their expression. The low abundance of some miRNAs and their time- and tissue-specific expression patterns make experimental miRNA identification difficult. We present here a computational method for genome-wide prediction of Arabidopsis thaliana microRNAs and their target mRNAs. This method uses characteristic features of known plant miRNAs as criteria to search for miRNAs conserved between Arabidopsis and Oryza sativa. Extensive sequence complementarity between miRNAs and their target mRNAs is used to predict miRNA-regulated Arabidopsis transcripts.RESULTS:Our prediction covered 63% of known Arabidopsis miRNAs and identified 83 new miRNAs. Evidence for the expression of 25 predicted miRNAs came from northern blots, their presence in the Arabidopsis Small RNA Project database, and massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) data. Putative targets functionally conserved between Arabidopsis and O. sativa were identified for most newly identified miRNAs. Independent microarray data showed that the expression levels of some mRNA targets anti-correlated with the accumulation pattern of their corresponding regulatory miRNAs. The cleavage of three target mRNAs by miRNA binding was validated in 5' RACE experiments.CONCLUSIONS:We identified new plant miRNAs conserved between Arabidopsis and O. sativa and report a wide range of transcripts as potential miRNA targets. Because MPSS data are generated from polyadenylated RNA molecules, our results suggest that at least some miRNA precursors are polyadenylated at certain stages. The broad range of putative miRNA targets indicates that miRNAs participate in the regulation of a variety of biological processes.},

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are one class of ∼21 nt small RNAs that originate from endogenous fold-back precursors found in plants and animals. They recognize complementary target sites in target mRNAs and guide them to cleavage or translational arrest. Studies of conserved miRNA networks in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and other plants have revealed that they fulfill essential regulatory roles. Most of the ancient miRNAs regulate transcription factors involved in plant development and hormone signaling. Here, we characterize the miR396 regulatory network. While miR396 regulates <italic>GRF</italic> transcription factors, at least in angiosperms and gymnosperms, this miRNA additionally regulates another transcription factor of the bHLH class but only in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and closely related species. Most conspicuously, the regulation of both conserved and new targets is important for leaf development in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. We also show that miRNA variants can exist in certain species and that they can display an enhanced activity towards their targets. In summary, we propose that conserved miRNA regulatory networks might expand their functions by the recruitment of additional targets as well as by slight variations in the small RNA sequences.</p>},

    abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 21-24 nucleotides long molecules processed from imperfect double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). They regulate gene expression by targeting complementary mRNA for cleavage or interfering with their translation. In Arabidopsis, point mutations in or short truncations of the nuclear DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1) or HEN1 protein reduce miRNA accumulation and increase uncleaved target mRNAs accumulation, resulting in developmental abnormalities. Here, we show that miRNA accumulation also depends on the activity of HYL1, a nuclear dsRNA binding protein. hyl1 mutants exhibit developmental defects overlapping with that of dcl1 and hen1 mutants, suggesting that DCL1, HEN1, and HYL1 act together in the nucleus. We validate additional target mRNAs and show that reduced miRNA accumulation in hyl1 correlates with an increased accumulation of uncleaved target mRNAs, including meristem- and auxin-related genes, providing clues for the developmental abnormalities of hyl1 and for the previous identification of hyl1 as a mutant with altered responses to phytohormones. Lastly, we show that posttranscriptional transgene silencing occurs in hyl1, suggesting that HYL1 has specialized function in the plant miRNA pathway, whereas the HYL1-related RDE-4 and R2D2 proteins associate with DICER in the cytoplasm and act in the RNAi pathway in C. elegans and Drosophila, respectively.},

    abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short regulatory RNAs processed from partially self-complementary foldbacks within longer MIRNA primary transcripts. Several MIRNA families are conserved deeply through land plants, but many are present only in closely related species or are species specific. The finding of numerous evolutionarily young MIRNA, many with low expression and few if any targets, supports a rapid birth-death model for MIRNA evolution. A systematic analysis of MIRNA genes and families in the close relatives, Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata, was conducted using both whole-genome comparisons and high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs. Orthologs of 143 A. thaliana MIRNA genes were identified in A. lyrata, with nine having significant sequence or processing changes that likely alter function. In addition, at least 13\% of MIRNA genes in each species are unique, despite their relatively recent speciation (approximately 10 million years ago). Alignment of MIRNA foldbacks to the Arabidopsis genomes revealed evidence for recent origins of 32 families by inverted or direct duplication of mostly protein-coding gene sequences, but less than half of these yield miRNA that are predicted to target transcripts from the originating gene family. miRNA nucleotide divergence between A. lyrata and A. thaliana orthologs was higher for young MIRNA genes, consistent with reduced purifying selection compared with deeply conserved MIRNA genes. Additionally, target sites of younger miRNA were lost more frequently than for deeply conserved families. In summary, our systematic analyses emphasize the dynamic nature of the MIRNA complement of plant genomes.},

    abstract = {Major copper proteins in the cytoplasm of plant cells are plastocyanin, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, and cytochrome c oxidase. Under copper limited conditions, expression of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase is down-regulated and the protein is replaced by iron superoxide dismutase in chloroplasts. We present evidence that a micro-RNA, miR398, mediates this regulation in Arabidopsis thaliana, by directing the degradation of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase mRNA when copper is limited. Sequence analysis indicated that the transcripts encoding cytosolic copper/zinc superoxide dismutase and COX5b-1, a subunit of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, are also targeted by miR398. This regulation via miR398 takes place in response to changes in a low range of copper levels (0.2-0.5 microM), indicating that miR398 is involved in a response to copper limitation. On the other hand, another major copper protein, plastocyanin, which is involved in photosynthetic electron flow and is essential in higher plants, was not regulated via miR398. We propose that miR398 is a key factor in copper homeostasis in plants and regulates the stability of mRNAs of major copper proteins under copper-limited conditions.},

abstract = {The functions of the vast majority of genes encoding R2R3 MYB domain proteins remain unknown. The closely related MYB33 and MYB65 genes of Arabidopsis thaliana have high sequence similarity to the barley (Hordeum vulgare) GAMYB gene. T-DNA insertional mutants were isolated for both genes, and a myb33 myb65 double mutant was defective in anther development. In myb33 myb65 anthers, the tapetum undergoes hypertrophy at the pollen mother cell stage, resulting in premeiotic abortion of pollen development. However, myb33 myb65 sterility was conditional, where fertility increased both under higher light or lower temperature conditions. Thus, MYB33/MYB65 facilitate, but are not essential for, anther development. Neither single mutant displayed a phenotype, implying that MYB33 and MYB65 are functionally redundant. Consistent with functional redundancy, promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) fusions of MYB33 and MYB65 gave identical expression patterns in flowers (sepals, style, receptacle, anther filaments, and connective but not in anthers themselves), shoot apices, and root tips. By contrast, expression of a MYB33:GUS translational fusion in flowers was solely in young anthers (consistent with the male sterile phenotype), and no staining was seen in shoot meristems or root tips. A microRNA target sequence is present in the MYB genes, and mutating this sequence in the MYB33:GUS fusion results in an expanded expression pattern, in tissues similar to that observed in the promoter-GUS lines, implying that the microRNA target sequence is restricting MYB33 expression. Arabidopsis transformed with MYB33 containing the mutated microRNA target had dramatic pleiotrophic developmental defects, suggesting that restricting MYB33 expression, especially in the shoot apices, is essential for proper plant development.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulatory molecules in most eukaryotes and identification of their target mRNAs is essential for their functional analysis. Whereas conventional methods rely on computational prediction and subsequent experimental validation of target RNAs, we directly sequenced >28,000,000 signatures from the 5' ends of polyadenylated products of miRNA-mediated mRNA decay, isolated from inflorescence tissue of Arabidopsis thaliana, to discover novel miRNA-target RNA pairs. Within the set of approximately 27,000 transcripts included in the 8,000,000 nonredundant signatures, several previously predicted but nonvalidated targets of miRNAs were found. Like validated targets, most showed a single abundant signature at the miRNA cleavage site, particularly in libraries from a mutant deficient in the 5'-to-3' exonuclease AtXRN4.

	abstract = {To better understand the diversity of small silencing RNAs expressed in plants, we employed high-throughput pyrosequencing to obtain 887,000 reads corresponding to Arabidopsis thaliana small RNAs. They represented 340,000 unique sequences, a substantially greater diversity than previously obtained in any species. Most of the small RNAs had the properties of heterochromatic small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) associated with DNA silencing in that they were preferentially 24 nucleotides long and mapped to intergenic regions. Their density was greatest in the proximal and distal pericentromeric regions, with only a slightly preferential propensity to match repetitive elements. Also present were 38 newly identified microRNAs (miRNAs) and dozens of other plausible candidates. One miRNA mapped within an intron of DICER-LIKE 1 (DCL1), suggesting a second homeostatic autoregulatory mechanism for DCL1 expression; another defined the phase for siRNAs deriving from a newly identified trans-acting siRNA gene (TAS4); and two depended on DCL4 rather than DCL1 for their accumulation, indicating a second pathway for miRNA biogenesis in plants. More generally, our results revealed the existence of a layer of miRNA-based control beyond that found previously that is evolutionarily much more fluid, employing many newly emergent and diverse miRNAs, each expressed in specialized tissues or at low levels under standard growth conditions.},

They recognize their target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) by sequence complementarity and guide them to cleavage or translational arrest. So far, the prediction of plant miRNA-target pairs generally relies on the use of empirical parameters deduced from known miRNA-target interactions. RESULTS: We developed comTAR, a web tool for the prediction of miRNA targets that is mainly based on the conservation of the potential regulation in different species. We used data generated from a pipeline applied to transcript datasets of 33 angiosperms that was used to build a database of potential miRNA targets of different plant species. The database contains information describing each miRNA-target pair, their function and evolutionary conservation, while the results are displayed in a user-friendly interface. The tool also allows the search using new miRNAs. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The Web site is free to all users, with no login requirements, at http://rnabiology.ibr-conicet.gov.ar/comtar.},

We have focused on the related miR159 and miR319 families, which share sequence identity at 17 of 21 nucleotides, yet affect different developmental processes through distinct targets. MiR159 regulates MYB mRNAs, while miR319 predominantly acts on TCP mRNAs. In the case of miR319, MYB targeting plays at most a minor role because miR319 expression levels and domain limit its ability to affect MYB mRNAs. In contrast, in the case of miR159, the miRNA sequence prevents effective TCP targeting. We complement these observations by identifying nucleotide positions relevant for miRNA activity with mutants recovered from a suppressor screen. Together, our findings reveal that functional specialization of miR159 and miR319 is achieved through both expression and sequence differences.},

The rate of deposition of novel microRNAs and the number of researchers involved in their discovery continue to increase, driven largely by small RNA deep sequencing experiments.

Here, we describe recent developments of the miRBase database to address this issue. In particular, we describe the collation and use of deep sequencing data sets to assign levels of confidence to miRBase entries. We now provide a high confidence subset of miRBase entries, based on the pattern of mapped reads. The high confidence microRNA data set is available alongside the complete microRNA collection at http://www.mirbase.org/.

    abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are defined by their precise processing from a longer stem-loop precursor and by their subsequent ability to direct the regulation of target RNAs distinct from the miRNA precursor. Several lines of evidence suggest that miRNAs arose at least twice during eukaryotic evolution from an ancestral, pan-eukaryotic small RNA producing molecular machinery, though alternative scenarios cannot be ruled out. A handful of plant miRNAs are strongly expressed, widely conserved among plants, and have identical targets in long-diverged species; most of these very well conserved miRNA-target relationships involve DNA-binding transcription factors with suspected roles in developmental control. In contrast, a much greater number of plant miRNAs are weakly expressed, poorly conserved, and have few if any readily identifiable targets. These miRNAs appear to be evolutionarily "transient", and many of them may be of little to no selective value. However, this ever-changing cast of transient miRNAs could provide a reservoir of potentially useful miRNAs from which new regulatory interactions sometimes are selected.},

In plants, these approximately 21-nucleotide RNAs are processed from stem-loop regions of long primary transcripts by a Dicer-like enzyme and are loaded into silencing complexes, where they generally direct cleavage of complementary mRNAs. Although plant miRNAs have some conserved functions extending beyond development, the importance of miRNA-directed gene regulation during plant development is now particularly clear. Identified in plants less than four years ago, miRNAs are already known to play numerous crucial roles at each major stage of development-typically at the cores of gene regulatory networks, targeting genes that are themselves regulators, such as those encoding transcription factors and F-box proteins.},

@article{Lobbes2006,
abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) function as sequence-specific guides that control gene expression by post-transcriptional gene silencing. Many miRNAs influence plant development by regulating the accumulation of transcripts that encode transcription factors. Mutants defective in miRNA accumulation, such as dcl1, hen1, hyl1 and ago1, have pleiotropic developmental phenotypes. The serrate-1 (se-1) mutant of Arabidopsis also shows a highly pleiotropic phenotype, which overlaps with the phenotypes of mutants defective in miRNA accumulation. Although it has been proposed that SERRATE (SE) functions specifically in miRNA-mediated repression of the leaf polarity genes PHABULOSA and PHAVOLUTA, microarray analysis shows upregulation of many genes known to be the targets of miRNAs in se-1. We show that SE is a general regulator of miRNA levels affecting the processing of primary miRNA to miRNA.},

@article{Han2004,
abstract = {The Arabidopsis HYL1 gene encodes a nuclear double-stranded RNA-binding protein. A knockout mutation of the hyl1 gene is recessive and pleiotropic, causing developmental abnormalities, increasing sensitivity to abscisic acid, and reducing sensitivity to auxin and cytokinin. We report that levels of several microRNAs (miRNAs; miR159, -167, and -171) are reduced in homozygous mutant plants, and levels of two of three tested target mRNAs are elevated. Conversely, the miRNA levels are elevated in plants expressing a HYL1 cDNA from a strong promoter, and the corresponding target RNAs are reduced. These changes result from alterations in the stability of the target RNAs. However, double-stranded RNA-induced posttranscriptional gene silencing is unaffected by the hyl1 mutation. One-third to one-half of the cellular HYL1 protein is in a macromolecular complex, and a GFP-HYL1 fusion protein is found predominantly in the nucleus, although it is observed in both nucleus and cytoplasm in some cells. Within nuclei, HYL1 is associated with subnuclear bodies and ring-like structures. These observations provide evidence that the HYL1 protein is part of a nuclear macromolecular complex that is involved in miRNA-mediated gene regulation. Because hyl1 mutants show marked abnormalities in hormone responses, these results further suggest that miRNA-mediated changes in mRNA stability play a vital role in plant hormone signaling.},

@article{Arazi2005,
abstract = {Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are one class of endogenous tiny RNAs that play important regulatory roles in plant development and responses to external stimuli. To date, miRNAs have been cloned from higher plants such as Arabidopsis, rice and pumpkin, and there is limited information on their identity in lower plants including Bryophytes. Bryophytes are among the oldest groups of land plants among the earth's flora, and are important for our understanding of the transition to life on land. To identify miRNAs that might have played a role early in land plant evolution, we constructed a library of small RNAs from the juvenile gametophyte (protonema) of the moss Physcomitrella patens. Sequence analysis revealed five higher plant miRNA homologues, including three members of the miR319 family, previously shown to be involved in the regulation of leaf morphogenesis, and miR156, which has been suggested to regulate several members of the SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING-LIKE (SPL) family in Arabidopsis. We have cloned PpSBP3, a moss SPL homologue that contains an miR156 complementary site, and demonstrated that its mRNA is cleaved within that site suggesting that it is an miR156 target in moss. Six additional candidate moss miRNAs were identified and shown to be expressed in the gametophyte, some of which were developmentally regulated or upregulated by auxin. Our observations suggest that miRNAs play important regulatory roles in mosses.},

    abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are widespread posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression. They are processed from longer primary transcripts that contain foldback structures (reviewed in). In animals, a complex formed by Drosha and DGCR8/Pasha recognizes the transition between the single-stranded RNA sequences and the stem loop to produce the first cleavage step in miRNA biogenesis. Whereas animal precursors are of uniform size and shape, their plant counterparts comprise a collection of variable stem loops, and little is known about the structural clues recognized during their processing. Here, we designed an unbiased approach based on the random mutagenesis of the MIR172a precursor to study miRNA processing in plants. Randomly mutated precursors were overexpressed in Arabidopsis, and their activity was determined in vivo. We gathered sequence data from these transgenes and used it to build a MIR172a precursor map highlighting relevant and neutral positions for its processing. A 15 nucleotide stem segment below the miRNA/miRNA() duplex was essential for MIR172a processing. In contrast, mutations in the terminal-loop region were mostly neutral, yet a loop was required for miR172 biogenesis. The results could be extended to other precursors, suggesting the existence of common features in at least part of the plant precursors.},

While animal miRNA precursors have homogenous structures, plant precursors comprise a collection of fold-backs with variable size and shape. Here, we design an approach to systematically analyze miRNA processing intermediates and characterize the biogenesis of most of the evolutionarily conserved miRNAs present in Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that plant miRNAs are processed by four mechanisms, depending on the sequential direction of the processing machinery and the number of cuts required to release the miRNA. Classification of the precursors according to their processing mechanism revealed specific structural determinants for each group. We found that the complexity of the miRNA processing pathways occurs in both ancient and evolutionarily young sequences and that members of the same family can be processed in different ways. We observed that different structural determinants compete for the processing machinery and that alternative miRNAs can be generated from a single precursor. The results provide an explanation for the structural diversity of miRNA precursors in plants and new insights toward the understanding of the biogenesis of small RNAs.},

    abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that derive from endogenous precursors harboring foldback structures. Plant miRNA precursors are quite variable in their size and shape. Still, the miRNA processing machinery, consisting of DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1) and accessory proteins recognize structural features on the precursors to cleave them at specific places releasing the mature miRNAs. The identification of miRNA processing intermediates in plants has mostly relied on a modified 5' RACE method, designed to detect the 5' end of uncapped RNAs. However, this method is time consuming and is, therefore, only practical for the analysis of a handful miRNAs. Here, we present a modification of this approach in order to perform genome-wide analysis of miRNA processing intermediates. Briefly, a reverse transcription is performed with a mixture of specific primers designed against all known miRNA precursors. miRNA processing intermediates are then specifically amplified to generate a library and subjected to deep sequencing. This method, called SPARE (Specific Parallel Amplification of 5' RNA Ends) allows the identification of processing intermediates for most of the Arabidopsis miRNAs. The results enable the determination of the DCL1 processing direction and the cleavage sites introduced by miRNA processing machinery in the precursors. The SPARE method can be easily adapted to detect miRNA-processing intermediates in other systems.},

    abstract = {The first step in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis usually involves cleavage at the base of its fold-back precursor. Here, we describe a non-canonical processing mechanism for miRNAs miR319 and miR159 in Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that their biogenesis begins with the cleavage of the loop, instead of the usual cut at the base of the stem-loop structure. DICER-LIKE 1 (DCL1) proceeds then with three additional cuts until the mature miRNA is released. We further show that the conserved upper stem of the miR319 precursor is essential to organize its biogenesis, whereas sequences below the miRNA/miRNA(*) region are dispensable. In addition, the bulges present in the fold-back structure reduce the accumulation of small RNAs other than the miRNA. The biogenesis of miR319 is conserved in the moss Physcomitrella patens, showing that this processing mechanism is ancient. These results provide new insights into the plasticity of small-RNA pathways.},
